# Bookstore

An app to help the LU Bookstore when LU's systems ineviatbly go down during the first two weeks.

### Running

You'll need to use the [Google App Engine Go runtime](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Go) for this.

Once you've got the runtime installed, it's as simple as running `$ goapp serve` from this repo's root. Open your browser to port 8080. The admin panel will be on port 8000.
